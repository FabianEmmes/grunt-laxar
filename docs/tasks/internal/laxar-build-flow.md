# The _laxar-build-flow_ Task

> For a given flow target, generates all artifacts that are needed to run that flow in the browser during development.

This task simply executes [*laxar-artifacts*](laxar-artifacts.md), [*laxar-dependencies*](laxar-dependencies.md), [*laxar-resources*](laxar-resources.md) and [*laxar-configure-watch*](laxar-configure-watch.md).


## Overview

*Note:* This task is an *internal building block* used by the grunt-laxar main tasks, and not considered a part of the stable API.

*Run this task with the `grunt laxar-configure laxar-build-flow:{target}` command.*

The possible targets are determined by the configuration which is generated by the [*laxar-configure*](../laxar-configure.md) task.
If used without *laxar-configure*, the task targets, files and options may be specified manually according to the grunt
[Configuring tasks](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks) guide.
