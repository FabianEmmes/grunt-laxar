# The *laxar-dist-css* Task

> For a given flow target, uses [*clean-css*](https://github.com/jakubpawlowicz/clean-css) (via [*cssmin*](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-cssmin)) in order to create a single, optimized CSS file for each theme.

The generated CSS stylesheet is stored under `{dest}/{target}/dist/{theme}.css`.
Here, *dest* refers to the configured destination directory (usually `var/flows`), *target* corresponds to the flow target that was specified when running the task, and *theme* is the full name of an application theme, or `default.theme`.
Each theme is accompanied by a *source map* located at `{dest}/{target}/dist/{theme}.css.map`.


## Overview

*Note:* This task is an *internal building block* used by the grunt-laxar main tasks, and not considered a part of the stable API.

*Run this task with the `grunt laxar-configure laxar-dist-css:{target}` command.*

The possible targets are determined by the configuration which is generated by the [*laxar-configure*](laxar-configure.md) task.
If used without *laxar-configure*, the task targets, files and options may be specified manually according to the grunt
[Configuring tasks](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks) guide.
