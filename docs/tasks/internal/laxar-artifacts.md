# The *laxar-artifacts* Task

> For a given flow target, collects all reachable artifacts and produce an *artifacts model* in JSON format.

The generated _artifacts model_ serves as a base for many other tasks and is very useful for tooling and inspection.

The artifacts model is stored under `{dest}/{target}/tooling/artifacts.json`.
Here, *dest* refers to the configured destination directory (usually `var/flows`), and *target* corresponds to the flow target that was specified when running the task.


## Overview

*Note:* This task is an *internal building block* used by the grunt-laxar main tasks, and not considered a part of the stable API.

*Run this task with the `grunt laxar-configure laxar-artifacts:target` command.*

The possible targets are determined by the configuration which is generated by the [*laxar-configure*](../laxar-configure.md) task.
If used without *laxar-configure*, the task targets, files and options may be specified manually according to the grunt
[Configuring tasks](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks) guide.
