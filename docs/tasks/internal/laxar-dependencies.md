# The *laxar-dependencies* Task

> For a given flow target, generates an AMD module that references all direct dependencies.

A module is generated, which depends on the controller modules of all reachable widgets and activities as well the modules of their controls.
When loaded using _RequireJS_ or bundled using _r.js_ this causes all transitive dependencies of these modules to be included as well.

The dependencies module is stored under `{dest}/{target}/dependencies.js`.
Here, *dest* refers to the configured destination directory (usually `var/flows`), and *target* corresponds to the flow target that was specified when running the task.


## Overview

*Note:* This task is an *internal building block* used by the grunt-laxar main tasks, and not considered a part of the stable API.

*Run this task with the `grunt laxar-configure laxar-dependencies:{target}` command.*

The possible targets are determined by the configuration which is generated by the [*laxar-configure*](../laxar-configure.md) task.
If used without *laxar-configure*, the task targets, files and options may be specified manually according to the grunt
[Configuring tasks](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks) guide.
