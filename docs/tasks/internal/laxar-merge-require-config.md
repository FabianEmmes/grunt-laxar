# The *laxar-merge-require-config* Task

> For a given flow target, collects and merges all *require_config.js* files found in widgets and controls

The task scans through all widget and control directories reachable from the given flow and collects all existing *require_config.js* files.
It is assumed that the configuration for the artifact is defined as a global `require` object in there.

Using the application `require_config.js` as a basis, a merged configuration for each flow will be generated under `{dest}/{target}/require_config.js`.
Here, *dest* refers to the configured destination directory (usually `var/flows`), and *target* corresponds to the flow target that was specified when running the task.


## Overview

*Note:* This task is an *internal building block* used by the grunt-laxar main tasks, and not considered a part of the stable API.

*Run this task with the `grunt laxar-configure laxar-merge-require-config:{target}` command.*

The possible targets are determined by the configuration which is generated by the [*laxar-configure*](../laxar-configure.md) task.
If used without *laxar-configure*, the task targets, files and options may be specified manually according to the grunt
[Configuring tasks](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks) guide.
