# The *laxar-test-widget-internal* Task

> For a given flow widget, run spec tests

This task needs a configured target for each widget that it should be run for.


## Overview

*Note:* This task is an *internal building block* used by the grunt-laxar main tasks, and not considered a part of the stable API.

*Run this task with the `grunt laxar-configure laxar-test-widget-internal:{target}` command.*

The possible targets are determined by the configuration which is generated by the [*laxar-configure*](laxar-configure.md) task.
If used without *laxar-configure*, the task targets, files and options may be specified manually according to the grunt [Configuring tasks](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks) guide.
