# The *laxar-develop-no-watch* Task

> Generates *dependencies* and *resource listings* required by the LaxarJS runtime, and starts a *development server* **without** live reloading.

This task is an _end-user task_ of grunt-laxar and thus considered part of the public API.

This is the same as [laxar-develop](laxar-develop.md), but without watching of files or live reloading.


## Overview

*Run this task with the `grunt laxar-develop-no-watch` command.*

This task has no further options.
